 abstract = {Word segmentation problem is widely solved as the sequence labeling problem. The traditional way to this kind of problem is machine learning method like conditional random field with hand-crafted features. Recently, deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance on word segmentation task and a popular method of them is LSTM networks. This paper gives a method to introduce numerical statistics-based features counted on unlabeled data into LSTM networks and analyzes how it enhances the performance of word segmentation model. We add pre-trained character-bigram embedding, pointwise mutual information, accessor variety and punctuation variety into our model and compare their performances on different datasets including three datasets from CoNLL-2017 shared task and three datasets of simplified Chinese. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on two of them and get comparable results on the rest.},

 abstract = {Cross-lingual model transfer has been a promising approach for inducing dependency parsers for low-resource languages where annotated treebanks are not available. The major obstacles for the model transfer approach are two-fold: 1. Lexical features are not directly transferable across languages; 2. Target language-specific syntactic structures are difficult to be recovered. To address these two challenges, we present a novel representation learning framework for multi-source transfer parsing. Our framework allows multi-source transfer parsing using full lexical features straightforwardly. By evaluating on the Google universal dependency treebanks (v2.0), our best models yield an absolute improvement of 6.53% in averaged labeled attachment score, as compared with delexicalized multi-source transfer models. We also significantly outperform the state-of-the-art transfer system proposed most recently.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in language modeling using recurrent neural networks have made it viable to model language as distributions over characters. By learning to predict the next character on the basis of previous characters, such models have been shown to automatically internalize linguistic concepts such as words, sentences, subclauses and even sentiment. In this paper, we propose to leverage the internal states of a trained character language model to produce a novel type of word embedding which we refer to as contextual string embeddings. Our proposed embeddings have the distinct properties that they (a) are trained without any explicit notion of words and thus fundamentally model words as sequences of characters, and (b) are contextualized by their surrounding text, meaning that the same word will have different embeddings depending on its contextual use. We conduct a comparative evaluation against previous embeddings and find that our embeddings are highly useful for downstream tasks: across four classic sequence labeling tasks we consistently outperform the previous state-of-the-art. In particular, we significantly outperform previous work on English and German named entity recognition (NER), allowing us to report new state-of-the-art F1-scores on the CoNLL03 shared task.},

role in both language learning and processing. The need to compare languages
with regard to their complexity resulted in a multitude of approaches and
methods, ranging from accounts targeting specific structural features to global
quantification of variation more generally. In this paper, we investigate the
degree to which morphological complexity measures are mutually correlated in a
sample of more than 500 languages of 101 language families. We use human expert
judgements from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS), and compare them
to four quantitative measures automatically calculated from language corpora.
These consist of three previously defined corpus-derived measures, which are
all monolingual, and one new measure based on automatic word-alignment across
pairs of languages. We find strong correlations between all the measures, illustrating that both expert judgements and automated approaches converge to
similar complexity ratings, and can be used interchangeably.},

Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies.
Our system includes three pipelined components: \textit{tokenization}, \textit{Part-of-Speech} (POS) \textit{tagging} and \textit{dependency parsing}.
We use character-based bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for
both tokenization and POS tagging.
Afterwards, we employ a list-based transition-based algorithm for general
non-projective parsing and present an improved Stack-LSTM-based architecture
for representing each transition state and making predictions.
Furthermore, to parse low/zero-resource languages and cross-domain data, we use

We demonstrate substantial gains against the UDPipe baseline, with an average
improvement of 3.76\% in LAS of all languages. And finally, we rank the 4th

We base our submission on Stanford's winning system for the CoNLL 2017 shared task and make two effective extensions: 1) incorporating deep contextualized word embeddings into both the part of speech tagger and parser; 2) ensembling parsers trained with different initialization. We also explore different ways of concatenating treebanks for further improvements. Experimental results on the development data show the effectiveness of our methods. In the final evaluation, our system was ranked first according to LAS (75.84%) and outperformed the other systems by a large margin.},

Chinese word segmentation (CWS). Most existing methods focus on improve the
performance for each single criterion. However, it is interesting to exploit
these different criteria and mining their common underlying knowledge. In this
paper, we propose adversarial multi-criteria learning for CWS by integrating
shared knowledge from multiple heterogeneous segmentation criteria. 
Experiments on eight corpora with heterogeneous segmentation criteria show that
the performance of each corpus obtains a significant improvement, compared to
single-criterion learning. Source codes of this paper are available on Github.},

of two components. The first performs joint word and sentence segmentation on

bypasses the need for part-of-speech tagging, but uses word embeddings based on
universal tag distributions. We achieved a macro-averaged LAS F1 of 65.11 in
the official test run, which improved to 70.49 after bug fixes. We obtained the
2nd best result for sentence segmentation with a score of 89.03.},

address the rare word problem that abounds in languages with complex
morphology, we include a character-based word representation that uses an LSTM
to produce embeddings from sequences of characters. Our system was ranked first

@article{Ferreiros2001,
 abstract = {This paper aims to outline an analysis and interpretation of the process that led to First-Order Logic and its consolidation as a core system of modern logic. We begin with an historical overview of landmarks along the road to modern logic, and proceed to a philosophical discussion casting doubt on the possibility of a purely rational justification of the actual delimitation of First-Order-Logic. On this basis, we advance the thesis that a certain historical tradition was essential to the emergence of modern logic; this traditional context is analyzed as consisting in some guiding principles and, particularly, a set of exemplares (i.e., paradigmatic instances). Then, we proceed to interpret the historical course of development reviewed in section 1, which can broadly be described as a two-phased movement of expansion and then restriction of the scope of logical theory. We shall try to pinpoint ambivalencies in the process, and the main motives for subsequent changes. Among the latter, one may emphasize the spirit of modern axiomatics, the situation of foundational insecurity in the 1920s, the resulting desire to find systems well-behaved from a proof-theoretical point of view, and the metatheoretical results of the 1930s. Not surprisingly, the mathematical and, more specifically, the foundational context in which Firs-Order-Logic matured will be seen to have played a primary role in its shaping.},

Ideally, the linguistic levels of morphology, syntax and semantics would
benefit each other by being trained in a single model.
We introduce a joint many-task model together with a strategy for successively
growing its depth to solve increasingly complex tasks.
Higher layers include shortcut connections to lower-level task predictions to
reflect linguistic hierarchies.
We use a simple regularization term to allow for optimizing all model weights
to improve one task's loss without exhibiting catastrophic interference of the
other tasks.
Our single end-to-end model obtains state-of-the-art or competitive results on
five different tasks from tagging, parsing, relatedness, and entailment tasks.},

First we show that recent advances in word representations greatly diminish the need for domain adaptation when the target domain is syntactically similar to the source domain. As evidence, we train a parser on the Wall Street Journal alone that achieves over 90% F1 on the Brown corpus. For more syntactically distant domains, we provide a simple way to adapt a parser using only dozens of partial annotations. For instance, we increase the percentage of error-free geometry-domain parses in a held-out set from 45% to 73% using approximately five dozen training examples. In the process, we demonstrate a new state-of-the-art single model result on the Wall Street Journal test set of 94.3%. This is an absolute increase of 1.7% over the previous state-of-the-art of 92.6%.},

relatively limited amount of labeled data and the non-sequential nature of the
AMR graphs.
We present a novel training procedure that can lift this limitation using
millions of unlabeled sentences and careful preprocessing of the AMR graphs.
For AMR parsing, our model achieves competitive results of 62.1 SMATCH, the
current best score reported without significant use of external semantic
resources.
For AMR generation, our model establishes a new state-of-the-art performance of
BLEU 33.8.
We present extensive ablative and qualitative analysis including strong
evidence that sequence-based AMR models are robust against ordering variations

To alleviate the computational cost of this iterative process, we introduce a coarse-to-fine approach that incorporates a less accurate but more efficient bilinear factor, enabling more aggressive pruning without hurting accuracy.

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a probabilistic parsing model that defines a proper
conditional probability distribution over non-projective
dependency trees for a given sentence, using neural representations as inputs.
The neural network architecture is based on bi-directional LSTMCNNs, which automatically benefits from both word- and character-level
representations, by using a combination of bidirectional LSTMs and CNNs. On top
of the neural network, we introduce a probabilistic structured layer, defining
a conditional log-linear model over non-projective trees. By exploiting
Kirchhoff’s Matrix-Tree Theorem (Tutte, 1984), the partition functions and
marginals can be computed efficiently, leading to a straightforward end-to-end
model training procedure via back-propagation. We evaluate our model on 17
different datasets, across 14 different languages. Our parser achieves
state-of-the-art parsing performance on nine datasets.},

Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large text corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.},

 abstract = {Sequential prediction problems such as imitation learning, where future observations depend on previous predictions (actions), violate the common i.i.d. assumptions made in statistical learning. This leads to poor performance in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem. [pdf]},

In this paper we develop a finite context approach through stacked convolutions, which can be more efficient since they allow parallelization over sequential tokens. We propose a novel simplified gating mechanism that outperforms Oord et al. (2016) and investigate the impact of key architectural decisions. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art on the WikiText-103 benchmark, even though it features long-term dependencies, as well as competitive results on the Google Billion Words benchmark. Our model reduces the latency to score a sentence by an order of magnitude compared to a recurrent baseline. To our knowledge, this is the first time a non-recurrent approach is competitive with strong recurrent models on these large scale language tasks.},

 abstract = {Imitation Learning, while applied successfully on many large real-world problems, is typically addressed as a standard supervised learning problem, where it is assumed the training and testing data are i.i.d..  This is not true in imitation learning as the learned policy influences the future test inputs (states) upon which it will be tested. We show that this leads to compounding errors and a regret bound that grows quadratically in the time horizon of the task. We propose two alternative algorithms for imitation learning where training occurs over several episodes of interaction. These two approaches share in common that the learner’s policy is slowly modified from executing the expert’s policy to the learned policy. We show that this leads to stronger performance guarantees and demonstrate the improved performance on two challenging problems: training a learner to play 1) a 3D racing game (Super Tux Kart) and 2) Mario Bros.; given input images from the games and corresponding actions taken by a human expert and near-optimal planner respectively.},

Dependencies from raw text. Our system features an ensemble of three global
parsing paradigms, one graph-based and two transition-based. Each model
leverages character-level bi-directional LSTMs as lexical feature extractors to
encode morphological information. Though relying on baseline tokenizers and
focusing only on parsing, our system ranked second in the official end-to-end
evaluation with a macro-average of 75.00 LAS F1 score over 81 test treebanks.
In addition, we had the top average performance on the four surprise languages
and on the small treebank subset.},

 abstract = {Ensembling is a well-known technique in neural machine translation (NMT) to
improve system performance. Instead of a single neural net, multiple neural
nets with the same topology are trained separately, and the decoder generates
predictions by averaging over the individual models. Ensembling often improves
the quality of the generated translations drastically. However, it is not
suitable for production systems because it is cumbersome and slow. This work
aims to reduce the runtime to be on par with a single system without
compromising the translation quality. First, we show that the ensemble can be
unfolded into a single large neural network which imitates the output of the
ensemble system. We show that unfolding can already improve the runtime in
practice since more work can be done on the GPU. We proceed by describing a set
of techniques to shrink the unfolded network by reducing the dimensionality of
layers. On Japanese-English we report that the resulting network has the size
and decoding speed of a single NMT network but performs on the level of a
3-ensemble system.},

To test it, we devise an expressive framework to align AMR graphs to dependency graphs, which we use to annotate 200 AMRs. Our annotation explains how 97% of AMR edges are evoked by words or syntax. Previously existing AMR alignment frameworks did not allow for mapping AMR onto syntax, and as a consequence they explained at most 23%. While we find that there are indeed many cases where AMR annotations closely mirror syntax, there are also pervasive differences. We use our annotations to test a baseline AMR-to-syntax aligner, finding that this task is more difficult than AMR-to-string alignment; and to pinpoint errors in an AMR parser. We make our data and code freely available for further research on AMR parsing and generation, and the relationship of AMR to syntax.},

@article{TACL145,
 abstract = {Greedy transition-based parsers are very fast but tend to suffer from error propagation. This problem is aggravated by the fact that they are normally trained using oracles that are deterministic and incomplete in the sense that they assume a unique canonical path through the transition system and are only valid as long as the parser does not stray from this path. In this paper, we give a general characterization of oracles that are nondeterministic and complete, present a method for deriving such oracles for transition systems that satisfy a property we call arc decomposition, and instantiate this method for three well-known transition systems from the literature. We say that these oracles are dynamic, because they allow us to dynamically explore alternative and non-optimal paths during training — in contrast to oracles that statically assume a unique optimal path. Experimental evaluation on a wide range of data sets clearly shows that using dynamic oracles to train greedy parsers gives substantial improvements in accuracy. Moreover, this improvement comes at no cost in terms of efficiency, unlike other techniques like beam search.},

The MRL used for the annotation was designed to support a portable, interactive tourist information system. We develop a semantic parser for this corpus by adapting the imitation learning algorithm DAGGER without requiring alignment information during training.

components of an AMR parser: concept identification and alignment. We first
build a Bidirectional LSTM based concept identifier that is able to incorporate
richer contextual information to learn sparse AMR concept labels. We then
extend an HMM-based word-to-concept alignment model with graph distance
distortion and a rescoring method during decoding to incorporate the structural
information in the AMR graph. We show integrating the two components into an
existing AMR parser results in consistently better performance over the state
of the art on various datasets.},

investigate the effectiveness of a range of external training sources for
neural word segmentation by building a modular segmentation model, pretraining
the most important submodule using rich external sources. Results show that
such pretraining significantly improves the model, leading to accuracies
competitive to the best methods on six benchmarks.},

Based on conventional conditional random fields (CRFs), SCRFs have been designed for the tasks of assigning labels to segments by extracting features from and describing transitions between segments instead of words. In this paper, we improve the existing SCRF methods by employing word-level and segment-level information simultaneously. First, word-level labels are utilized to derive the segment scores in SCRFs. Second, a CRF output layer and an SCRF output layer are integrated into a unified neural network and trained jointly. Experimental results on CoNLL 2003 named entity recognition (NER) shared task show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance when no external knowledge is used.},
