 abstract = {Word segmentation problem is widely solved as the sequence labeling problem. The traditional way to this kind of problem is machine learning method like conditional random field with hand-crafted features. Recently, deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance on word segmentation task and a popular method of them is LSTM networks. This paper gives a method to introduce numerical statistics-based features counted on unlabeled data into LSTM networks and analyzes how it enhances the performance of word segmentation model. We add pre-trained character-bigram embedding, pointwise mutual information, accessor variety and punctuation variety into our model and compare their performances on different datasets including three datasets from CoNLL-2017 shared task and three datasets of simplified Chinese. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on two of them and get comparable results on the rest.},

Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies.
Our system includes three pipelined components: \textit{tokenization},
\textit{Part-of-Speech} (POS) \textit{tagging} and \textit{dependency parsing}.
We use character-based bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for
both tokenization and POS tagging.
Afterwards, we employ a list-based transition-based algorithm for general
non-projective parsing and present an improved Stack-LSTM-based architecture
for representing each transition state and making predictions.
Furthermore, to parse low/zero-resource languages and cross-domain data, we use
a model transfer approach to make effective use of existing resources.
We demonstrate substantial gains against the UDPipe baseline, with an average
improvement of 3.76\% in LAS of all languages. And finally, we rank the 4th
place on the official test sets.},

 abstract = {Bagging and boosting are methods that generate a diverse ensemble of classifiers by manipulating the training data given to a ``base'' learning algorithm. Breiman has pointed out that they rely for their effectiveness on the instability of the base learning algorithm. An alternative approach to generating an ensemble is to randomize the internal decisions made by the base algorithm. This general approach has been studied previously by Ali and Pazzani and by Dietterich and Kong. This paper compares the effectiveness of randomization, bagging, and boosting for improving the performance of the decision-tree algorithm C4.5. The experiments show that in situations with little or no classification noise, randomization is competitive with (and perhaps slightly superior to) bagging but not as accurate as boosting. In situations with substantial classification noise, bagging is much better than boosting, and sometimes better than randomization.},

contrast to newswire articles, Tweets are usually informal and contain numerous
out-of-vocabulary words. Moreover, there is a lack of large scale labeled
datasets for this domain. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel neural
network to make use of out-of-domain labeled data, unlabeled in-domain data, and labeled in-domain data.  Inspired by adversarial neural networks, the
proposed method tries to learn common features through adversarial
discriminator. In addition, we hypothesize that domain-specific features of
target domain should be preserved in some degree. Hence, the proposed method
adopts a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder to perform this task.  Experimental
results on three different datasets  show that our method achieves better
performance than state-of-the-art methods.},

Despite that treebanks may belong to different languages or have different

This paper presents a universal framework for transfer parsing across

We consider two kinds of treebanks as source: the multilingual universal
treebanks and the monolingual heterogeneous treebanks.
Knowledge across the source and target treebanks are effectively transferred
through multi-level parameter sharing.
Experiments on several benchmark datasets in various languages demonstrate that
our approach can make effective use of arbitrary source treebanks to improve

 abstract = {We introduce a new deep learning model for semantic role labeling (SRL) that
significantly improves the state of the art, along with detailed analyses to
reveal its strengths and limitations. We use a deep highway BiLSTM architecture
with constrained decoding, while observing a number of recent best practices
for initialization and regularization. Our 8-layer ensemble model achieves 83.2
F1 on theCoNLL 2005 test set and 83.4 F1 on CoNLL 2012, roughly a 10% relative
error reduction over the previous state of the art. Extensive empirical
analysis of these gains show that (1) deep models excel at recovering
long-distance dependencies but can still make surprisingly obvious errors, and
(2) that there is still room for syntactic parsers to improve these results.},

 abstract = {Sequence-to-sequence models have shown strong performance across a broad range
of applications. However, their application to parsing and generating text
using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) has been limited, due to the
relatively limited amount of labeled data and the non-sequential nature of the
AMR graphs.
We present a novel training procedure that can lift this limitation using
millions of unlabeled sentences and careful preprocessing of the AMR graphs.
For AMR parsing, our model achieves competitive results of 62.1 SMATCH, the
current best score reported without significant use of external semantic
resources.
For AMR generation, our model establishes a new state-of-the-art performance of
BLEU 33.8.
We present extensive ablative and qualitative analysis including strong
evidence that sequence-based AMR models are robust against ordering variations
of graph-to-sequence conversions.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a probabilistic parsing model that defines a proper
conditional probability distribution over non-projective
dependency trees for a given sentence, using neural representations as inputs.
The neural network architecture is based on bi-directional LSTMCNNs,
which automatically benefits from both word- and character-level
representations, by using a combination of bidirectional LSTMs and CNNs. On top
of the neural network, we introduce a probabilistic structured layer, defining
a conditional log-linear model over non-projective trees. By exploiting
Kirchhoff’s Matrix-Tree Theorem (Tutte, 1984), the partition functions and
marginals can be computed efficiently, leading to a straightforward end-to-end
model training procedure via back-propagation. We evaluate our model on 17
different datasets, across 14 different languages. Our parser achieves
state-of-the-art parsing performance on nine datasets.},

 abstract = {Sequential prediction problems such as imitation learning, where future observations depend on previous predictions (actions), violate the common i.i.d. assumptions made in statistical learning. This leads to poor performance in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem. [pdf]},

 abstract = {Imitation Learning, while applied successfully on many large real-world problems, is typically addressed as a standard supervised learning problem, where it is assumed the training and testing data are i.i.d..  This is not true in imitation learning as the learned policy influences the future test inputs (states) upon which it will be tested. We show that this leads to compounding errors and a regret bound that grows quadratically in the time horizon of the task. We propose two alternative algorithms for imitation learning where training occurs over several episodes of interaction. These two approaches share in common that the learner’s policy is slowly modified from executing the expert’s policy to the learned policy. We show that this leads to stronger performance guarantees and demonstrate the improved performance on two challenging problems: training a learner to play 1) a 3D racing game (Super Tux Kart) and 2) Mario Bros.; given input images from the games and corresponding actions taken by a human expert and near-optimal planner respectively.},

For two recent systems for NER, we observe an absolute difference of one

systems perceived either as state-of-the-art or mediocre. Instead of publishing
and reporting single performance scores, we propose to compare score
distributions based on multiple executions.

tasks, we present network architectures that produce both superior performance
as well as are more stable with respect to the remaining hyperparameters.},

 abstract = {Ensembling is a well-known technique in neural machine translation (NMT) to
improve system performance. Instead of a single neural net, multiple neural
nets with the same topology are trained separately, and the decoder generates
predictions by averaging over the individual models. Ensembling often improves
the quality of the generated translations drastically. However, it is not
suitable for production systems because it is cumbersome and slow. This work
aims to reduce the runtime to be on par with a single system without
compromising the translation quality. First, we show that the ensemble can be
unfolded into a single large neural network which imitates the output of the
ensemble system. We show that unfolding can already improve the runtime in
practice since more work can be done on the GPU. We proceed by describing a set
of techniques to shrink the unfolded network by reducing the dimensionality of
layers. On Japanese-English we report that the resulting network has the size
and decoding speed of a single NMT network but performs on the level of a
3-ensemble system.},

 abstract = {Semantic parsing is the task of translating natural language utterances into a machine-interpretable meaning representation. Most approaches to this task have been evaluated on a small number of existing corpora which assume that all utterances must be interpreted according to a database and typically ignore context. In this paper we present a new, publicly available corpus for context-dependent semantic parsing. The MRL used for the annotation was designed to support a portable, interactive tourist information system. We develop a semantic parser for this corpus by adapting the imitation learning algorithm DAGGER without requiring alignment information during training. DAGGER improves upon independently trained classifiers by 9.0 and 4.8 points in F-score on the development and test sets respectively.},

 abstract = {Transition-based approaches based on local classification are attractive for dependency parsing due to their simplicity and speed, despite producing results slightly below the state-of-the-art. In this paper, we propose a new approach for approximate structured inference for transition-based parsing that produces scores suitable for global scoring using local models. This is accomplished with the introduction of error states in local training, which add information about incorrect derivation paths typically left out completely in locally-trained models. Using neural networks for our local classifiers, our approach produces the highest accuracy for transition-based dependency parsing in English.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a discriminative forest reranking algorithm for dependency parsing that can be seen as a form of efficient stacked parsing. A dynamic programming shift-reduce parser produces a packed derivation forest which is then scored by a discriminative reranker, using the 1-best tree output by the shift-reduce parser as guide features in addition to third-order graph-based features. To improve efficiency and accuracy, this paper also proposes a novel shift-reduce parser that eliminates the spurious ambiguity of arc-standard transition systems. Testing on the English Penn Treebank data, forest reranking gave a state-of-the-art unlabeled dependency accuracy of 93.12.},

 abstract = {We present a simple and effective scheme for dependency parsing which is based on bidirectional-LSTMs (BiLSTMs). Each sentence token is associated with a BiLSTM vector representing the token in its sentential context, and feature vectors are constructed by concatenating a few BiLSTM vectors. The BiLSTM is trained jointly with the parser objective, resulting in very effective feature extractors for parsing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by applying it to a greedy transition-based parser as well as to a globally optimized graph-based parser. The resulting parsers have very simple architectures, and match or surpass the state-of-the-art accuracies on English and Chinese.},

 abstract = {We train one multilingual model for dependency parsing and use it to parse sentences in several languages. The parsing model uses (i) multilingual word clusters and embeddings; (ii) token-level language information; and (iii) language-specific features (fine-grained POS tags). This input representation enables the parser not only to parse effectively in multiple languages, but also to generalize across languages based on linguistic universals and typological similarities, making it more effective to learn from limited annotations. Our parser's performance compares favorably to strong baselines in a range of data scenarios, including when the target language has a large treebank, a small treebank, or no treebank for training.},

extend an HMM-based word-to-concept alignment model with graph distance
distortion and a rescoring method during decoding to incorporate the structural
