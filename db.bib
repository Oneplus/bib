 abstract = {To add to WordNet's contents, and specifically to aid automatic reasoning with WordNet, we classify and label the current relations among derivationally and semantically related noun-verb pairs. Manual inspection of thousands of pairs shows that there is no one-to-one mapping of form and meaning for derivational affixes, which exhibit far less regularity than expected. We determine a set of semantic relations found across a number of morphologically defined noun-verb pair classes.},

show that our parser is competitive with the state of the art on the LDC2015E86

@article{Ferreiros2001,
 abstract = {This paper aims to outline an analysis and interpretation of the process that led to First-Order Logic and its consolidation as a core system of modern logic. We begin with an historical overview of landmarks along the road to modern logic, and proceed to a philosophical discussion casting doubt on the possibility of a purely rational justification of the actual delimitation of First-Order-Logic. On this basis, we advance the thesis that a certain historical tradition was essential to the emergence of modern logic; this traditional context is analyzed as consisting in some guiding principles and, particularly, a set of exemplares (i.e., paradigmatic instances). Then, we proceed to interpret the historical course of development reviewed in section 1, which can broadly be described as a two-phased movement of expansion and then restriction of the scope of logical theory. We shall try to pinpoint ambivalencies in the process, and the main motives for subsequent changes. Among the latter, one may emphasize the spirit of modern axiomatics, the situation of foundational insecurity in the 1920s, the resulting desire to find systems well-behaved from a proof-theoretical point of view, and the metatheoretical results of the 1930s. Not surprisingly, the mathematical and, more specifically, the foundational context in which Firs-Order-Logic matured will be seen to have played a primary role in its shaping.},

The topic extraction system is based on syn-  tactic ﬁltering, language modeling, near-duplicate de-  tection, and set cover heuristics. We have used Tweet-  Motif to deﬂate rumors, uncover scams, summarize  sentiment, and track political protests in real-time.

 abstract = {Sequence-to-sequence models have shown strong performance across a broad range
of applications. However, their application to parsing and generating text
using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) has been limited, due to the
relatively limited amount of labeled data and the non-sequential nature of the
AMR graphs.
We present a novel training procedure that can lift this limitation using
millions of unlabeled sentences and careful preprocessing of the AMR graphs.
For AMR parsing, our model achieves competitive results of 62.1 SMATCH, the
current best score reported without significant use of external semantic
resources.
For AMR generation, our model establishes a new state-of-the-art performance of
BLEU 33.8.
We present extensive ablative and qualitative analysis including strong
evidence that sequence-based AMR models are robust against ordering variations
of graph-to-sequence conversions.},

 abstract = {Sequential prediction problems such as imitation learning, where future observations depend on previous predictions (actions), violate the common i.i.d. assumptions made in statistical learning. This leads to poor performance in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem. [pdf]},

 abstract = {Imitation Learning, while applied successfully on many large real-world problems, is typically addressed as a standard supervised learning problem, where it is assumed the training and testing data are i.i.d..  This is not true in imitation learning as the learned policy influences the future test inputs (states) upon which it will be tested. We show that this leads to compounding errors and a regret bound that grows quadratically in the time horizon of the task. We propose two alternative algorithms for imitation learning where training occurs over several episodes of interaction. These two approaches share in common that the learner’s policy is slowly modified from executing the expert’s policy to the learned policy. We show that this leads to stronger performance guarantees and demonstrate the improved performance on two challenging problems: training a learner to play 1) a 3D racing game (Super Tux Kart) and 2) Mario Bros.; given input images from the games and corresponding actions taken by a human expert and near-optimal planner respectively.},

 abstract = {Ensembling is a well-known technique in neural machine translation (NMT) to
improve system performance. Instead of a single neural net, multiple neural
nets with the same topology are trained separately, and the decoder generates
predictions by averaging over the individual models. Ensembling often improves
the quality of the generated translations drastically. However, it is not
suitable for production systems because it is cumbersome and slow. This work
aims to reduce the runtime to be on par with a single system without
compromising the translation quality. First, we show that the ensemble can be
unfolded into a single large neural network which imitates the output of the
ensemble system. We show that unfolding can already improve the runtime in
practice since more work can be done on the GPU. We proceed by describing a set
of techniques to shrink the unfolded network by reducing the dimensionality of
layers. On Japanese-English we report that the resulting network has the size
and decoding speed of a single NMT network but performs on the level of a
3-ensemble system.},

Most approaches to this task have been evaluated on a small number of existing corpora which assume that all utterances must be interpreted according to a database and typically ignore context. In this paper we present a new, publicly available corpus for context-dependent semantic parsing. The MRL used for the annotation was designed to support a portable, interactive tourist information system. We develop a semantic parser for this corpus by adapting the imitation learning algorithm DAGGER without requiring alignment information during training. DAGGER improves upon independently trained classifiers by 9.0 and 4.8 points in F-score on the development and test sets respectively.},

To improve efficiency and accuracy, this paper also proposes a novel shift-reduce parser that eliminates the spurious ambiguity of arc-standard transition systems. Testing on the English Penn Treebank data, forest reranking gave a state-of-the-art unlabeled dependency accuracy of 93.12.},
