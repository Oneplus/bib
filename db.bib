 abstract = {Word segmentation problem is widely solved as the sequence labeling problem. The traditional way to this kind of problem is machine learning method like conditional random field with hand-crafted features. Recently, deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance on word segmentation task and a popular method of them is LSTM networks. This paper gives a method to introduce numerical statistics-based features counted on unlabeled data into LSTM networks and analyzes how it enhances the performance of word segmentation model. We add pre-trained character-bigram embedding, pointwise mutual information, accessor variety and punctuation variety into our model and compare their performances on different datasets including three datasets from CoNLL-2017 shared task and three datasets of simplified Chinese. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on two of them and get comparable results on the rest.},

 abstract = {Language complexity is an intriguing phenomenon argued to play an important
role in both language learning and processing. The need to compare languages
with regard to their complexity resulted in a multitude of approaches and
methods, ranging from accounts targeting specific structural features to global
quantification of variation more generally. In this paper, we investigate the
degree to which morphological complexity measures are mutually correlated in a
sample of more than 500 languages of 101 language families. We use human expert
judgements from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS), and compare them
to four quantitative measures automatically calculated from language corpora.
These consist of three previously defined corpus-derived measures, which are
all monolingual, and one new measure based on automatic word-alignment across
pairs of languages. We find strong correlations between all the measures, illustrating that both expert judgements and automated approaches converge to
similar complexity ratings, and can be used interchangeably.},

Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies.
Our system includes three pipelined components: \textit{tokenization}, \textit{Part-of-Speech} (POS) \textit{tagging} and \textit{dependency parsing}.
We use character-based bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for
both tokenization and POS tagging.
Afterwards, we employ a list-based transition-based algorithm for general
non-projective parsing and present an improved Stack-LSTM-based architecture
for representing each transition state and making predictions.
Furthermore, to parse low/zero-resource languages and cross-domain data, we use
a model transfer approach to make effective use of existing resources.
We demonstrate substantial gains against the UDPipe baseline, with an average
improvement of 3.76\% in LAS of all languages. And finally, we rank the 4th
place on the official test sets.},

language that embeds annotations related to traditional tasks such as named
entity recognition, semantic role labeling, word sense disambiguation and
co-reference resolution. We describe a transition-based parser for AMR that
parses sentences left-to-right, in linear time. We further propose a test-suite
that assesses specific subtasks that are helpful in comparing AMR parsers, and
show that our parser is competitive with the state of the art on the LDC2015E86
dataset and that it outperforms state-of-the-art parsers for recovering named
entities and handling polarity.},

of two components. The first performs joint word and sentence segmentation on

bypasses the need for part-of-speech tagging, but uses word embeddings based on
universal tag distributions. We achieved a macro-averaged LAS F1 of 65.11 in
the official test run, which improved to 70.49 after bug fixes. We obtained the

address the rare word problem that abounds in languages with complex
morphology, we include a character-based word representation that uses an LSTM
to produce embeddings from sequences of characters. Our system was ranked first

@article{Ferreiros2001,
 abstract = {This paper aims to outline an analysis and interpretation of the process that led to First-Order Logic and its consolidation as a core system of modern logic. We begin with an historical overview of landmarks along the road to modern logic, and proceed to a philosophical discussion casting doubt on the possibility of a purely rational justification of the actual delimitation of First-Order-Logic. On this basis, we advance the thesis that a certain historical tradition was essential to the emergence of modern logic; this traditional context is analyzed as consisting in some guiding principles and, particularly, a set of exemplares (i.e., paradigmatic instances). Then, we proceed to interpret the historical course of development reviewed in section 1, which can broadly be described as a two-phased movement of expansion and then restriction of the scope of logical theory. We shall try to pinpoint ambivalencies in the process, and the main motives for subsequent changes. Among the latter, one may emphasize the spirit of modern axiomatics, the situation of foundational insecurity in the 1920s, the resulting desire to find systems well-behaved from a proof-theoretical point of view, and the metatheoretical results of the 1930s. Not surprisingly, the mathematical and, more specifically, the foundational context in which Firs-Order-Logic matured will be seen to have played a primary role in its shaping.},

with constrained decoding, while observing a number of recent best practices
for initialization and regularization. Our 8-layer ensemble model achieves 83.2
F1 on theCoNLL 2005 test set and 83.4 F1 on CoNLL 2012, roughly a 10% relative
error reduction over the previous state of the art. Extensive empirical
analysis of these gains show that (1) deep models excel at recovering
long-distance dependencies but can still make surprisingly obvious errors, and
(2) that there is still room for syntactic parsers to improve these results.},

 abstract = {We revisit domain adaptation for parsers in the neural era. First we show that recent advances in word representations greatly diminish the need for domain adaptation when the target domain is syntactically similar to the source domain. As evidence, we train a parser on the Wall Street Journal alone that achieves over 90% F1 on the Brown corpus. For more syntactically distant domains, we provide a simple way to adapt a parser using only dozens of partial annotations. For instance, we increase the percentage of error-free geometry-domain parses in a held-out set from 45% to 73% using approximately five dozen training examples. In the process, we demonstrate a new state-of-the-art single model result on the Wall Street Journal test set of 94.3%. This is an absolute increase of 1.7% over the previous state-of-the-art of 92.6%.},

 abstract = {Sequence-to-sequence models have shown strong performance across a broad range
of applications. However, their application to parsing and generating text
using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) has been limited, due to the
relatively limited amount of labeled data and the non-sequential nature of the
AMR graphs.
We present a novel training procedure that can lift this limitation using
millions of unlabeled sentences and careful preprocessing of the AMR graphs.
For AMR parsing, our model achieves competitive results of 62.1 SMATCH, the
current best score reported without significant use of external semantic
resources.
For AMR generation, our model establishes a new state-of-the-art performance of
BLEU 33.8.
We present extensive ablative and qualitative analysis including strong
evidence that sequence-based AMR models are robust against ordering variations
of graph-to-sequence conversions.},

Our approach uses the antecedent distribution from a span-ranking architecture as an attention mechanism to iteratively refine span representations. This enables the model to softly consider multiple hops in the predicted clusters. To alleviate the computational cost of this iterative process, we introduce a coarse-to-fine approach that incorporates a less accurate but more efficient bilinear factor, enabling more aggressive pruning without hurting accuracy. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art span-ranking approach, our model significantly improves accuracy on the English OntoNotes benchmark, while being far more computationally efficient.},

conditional probability distribution over non-projective
dependency trees for a given sentence, using neural representations as inputs.
The neural network architecture is based on bi-directional LSTMCNNs, which automatically benefits from both word- and character-level
representations, by using a combination of bidirectional LSTMs and CNNs. On top
of the neural network, we introduce a probabilistic structured layer, defining
a conditional log-linear model over non-projective trees. By exploiting
Kirchhoff’s Matrix-Tree Theorem (Tutte, 1984), the partition functions and
marginals can be computed efficiently, leading to a straightforward end-to-end
model training procedure via back-propagation. We evaluate our model on 17
different datasets, across 14 different languages. Our parser achieves
state-of-the-art parsing performance on nine datasets.},

 abstract = {Sequential prediction problems such as imitation learning, where future observations depend on previous predictions (actions), violate the common i.i.d. assumptions made in statistical learning. This leads to poor performance in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem. [pdf]},

 abstract = {Imitation Learning, while applied successfully on many large real-world problems, is typically addressed as a standard supervised learning problem, where it is assumed the training and testing data are i.i.d..  This is not true in imitation learning as the learned policy influences the future test inputs (states) upon which it will be tested. We show that this leads to compounding errors and a regret bound that grows quadratically in the time horizon of the task. We propose two alternative algorithms for imitation learning where training occurs over several episodes of interaction. These two approaches share in common that the learner’s policy is slowly modified from executing the expert’s policy to the learned policy. We show that this leads to stronger performance guarantees and demonstrate the improved performance on two challenging problems: training a learner to play 1) a 3D racing game (Super Tux Kart) and 2) Mario Bros.; given input images from the games and corresponding actions taken by a human expert and near-optimal planner respectively.},

encode morphological information. Though relying on baseline tokenizers and
focusing only on parsing, our system ranked second in the official end-to-end

In addition, we had the top average performance on the four surprise languages

 abstract = {Ensembling is a well-known technique in neural machine translation (NMT) to
improve system performance. Instead of a single neural net, multiple neural
nets with the same topology are trained separately, and the decoder generates
predictions by averaging over the individual models. Ensembling often improves
the quality of the generated translations drastically. However, it is not
suitable for production systems because it is cumbersome and slow. This work
aims to reduce the runtime to be on par with a single system without
compromising the translation quality. First, we show that the ensemble can be
unfolded into a single large neural network which imitates the output of the
ensemble system. We show that unfolding can already improve the runtime in
practice since more work can be done on the GPU. We proceed by describing a set
of techniques to shrink the unfolded network by reducing the dimensionality of
layers. On Japanese-English we report that the resulting network has the size
and decoding speed of a single NMT network but performs on the level of a
3-ensemble system.},

Most approaches to this task have been evaluated on a small number of existing corpora which assume that all utterances must be interpreted according to a database and typically ignore context. In this paper we present a new, publicly available corpus for context-dependent semantic parsing. The MRL used for the annotation was designed to support a portable, interactive tourist information system. We develop a semantic parser for this corpus by adapting the imitation learning algorithm DAGGER without requiring alignment information during training. DAGGER improves upon independently trained classifiers by 9.0 and 4.8 points in F-score on the development and test sets respectively.},

To improve efficiency and accuracy, this paper also proposes a novel shift-reduce parser that eliminates the spurious ambiguity of arc-standard transition systems.

 abstract = {This paper proposes to tackle the AMR parsing bottleneck by improving two
components of an AMR parser: concept identification and alignment. We first
build a Bidirectional LSTM based concept identifier that is able to incorporate
richer contextual information to learn sparse AMR concept labels. We then
extend an HMM-based word-to-concept alignment model with graph distance
distortion and a rescoring method during decoding to incorporate the structural
information in the AMR graph. We show integrating the two components into an
existing AMR parser results in consistently better performance over the state
of the art on various datasets.},
